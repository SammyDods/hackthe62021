## Inspiration
Social dancing app with friends!

## What it does
Play Just Dance online with up to 4 players!

## How we built it
We used React, HTML, and CSS for the frontend and Python for the backend.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the toughest challenges was putting the webcam and detections into the app. We needed to research many tools to assist us.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Using Computer Vision was quite cool, we never mixed that with web development before.
